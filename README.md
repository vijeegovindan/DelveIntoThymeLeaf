# DelveIntoThymeLeaf
For this project you will be showing the properties of a Java object in an HTML page and letting the user update them.

Getting Started  

Bring up the Spring Initializr web page.

In the Search for dependencies field start to type "Thymeleaf". Once you've typed "Th" you should be able to select it from the list. This is the only dependency you need. You should see it in the Selected Dependencies.
Do not change any of the other defaults.
Click the Generate Project button to download it.
Unzip it
Now import the project in IntelliJ

Open IntelliJ
Click File -> New -> Projects from Existing Sources...
Select the pom.xml and click OK
On all the subsequent windows the defaults should be fine
Assignment  

Student POJO  

Create a Student JavaBean (empty constructor and getters and setters)

String firstName
String lastName
Grade grade (see Grade enum in starter files)
Generate empty constructor and getter and setters.

Copy the index.html starter file to src/main/resources/static directory.

Copy view_student.html and new_student.html starter files to the src/main/resources/templates directory.

Copy Grade.java and StudentController.java starter files to the src/main/java/com/example/demo directory.

Controller class  

Flesh out the @RequestMapping("/new_student") route.

new_student.html  

Update new_student.html to:

Add inputs for the student's first name and last name fields
Use Thymeleaf to access the grades that were added to the Model in the controller to show a pulldown list
Reminder: You must close all HTML tags or else Thymeleaf will complain. For example most <meta> tags are note closed and the browser will not complain but Thymeleaf won't work.

Note: Thymeleaf files are processed on the server. If you make changes to the file, you have to restart the server to see those changes. It does make development slow (slower than a dynamic language like Javascript, Ruby, Python). There are ways to speed this up but that's beyond the scope of this project.

Controller class  

In the controller class flesh out the @RequestMapping("/create_student") route.
